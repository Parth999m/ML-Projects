# Cricket Match Outcome Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of victory for both cricket teams during a match using advanced data science techniques. By leveraging a diverse dataset sourced from Kaggle, we aim to provide accurate predictions for match outcomes at different stages of the game.

## Key Features

- Utilized pandas and numpy libraries for efficient data loading, manipulation, and feature extraction.
- Employed data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to ensure data quality and consistency.
- Implemented logistic regression, a powerful classification algorithm, to predict match outcomes.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using sklearn, ensuring reliable model evaluation.
- Utilized one-hot encoding for categorical variables, enhancing model compatibility.
- Developed a local deployment using PyCharm, enabling real-time predictions and user interaction.
- Incorporated a user-friendly interface to input match data and receive victory likelihood predictions.
